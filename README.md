# WiebeTech Forensic UltraDockv6 Beginner(s) Guide
## Note
Before making this guide I was under the impression that specific software was required. I was wrong. [FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-product-downloads/) works.

The purpose of this guide is two-fold:
	- I recently recieved this device at B-Sides Bristol, as of writing, and cannot find a good resource for non-industry users of this device to help them get started with using it, so I am making one.
	- I would not like to have to remember this information for next time I need to set it up.

With that being said, the formatting of this guide will not be of a high standard as these are notes written during my FAFO process with this device.

### WiebeTech Validation Utility
The [WiebeTech Validation Utility](https://cdsg.com/products/forensic-write-blocking-drive-docks), found at the bottom end of the page in the 'Documents / Downloads' section, is a tool to validate that the write blocker is infact blocking writes.
While not inherently useful for hobbyists mucking about, as it is a tool for compliance, it is neat regardless.

### FTK Imager
I am kicking myself for not trying regular imaging software off bat but here we are. [FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-product-downloads/) works as normal, select File > Add Evidence Item > Select Physical Drive > Select the drive labeled WT Forensic UltraDo USB Device and you are good to go.
